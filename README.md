# Python-DownScaler-Script
DownScaling Images by using Python-OpenCV Library

This is a python script which used OpenCV library to downscale PBR materials by using BICUBIC, BILINEAR interpolations.

The logic is pretty straightforward and gives an opportunity to downscale any images to any size.

We can manually put any size of output texture.
